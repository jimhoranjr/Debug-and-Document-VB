# Debug-and-Document-VB
This will eventually hold several Excel addins I wrote to help Document and Debug 
VB scripts.  I have left all these spreadsheets as regular macro enabled spreadsheets.
You can convert them to the addin format by saving them as an Excel Addin ie. *.xlam. 
In the excel addin directory AppData > Roaming > Microsoft > Addins

When the addin is installed the icons to run them will appear in the Ribbon on
the Developers tab.

I have included several "Notes on" various spreadsheets as word docs to provide more
information on them.
